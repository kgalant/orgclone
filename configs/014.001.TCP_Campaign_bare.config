:The object we're dealing with (as in the local database)
OBJECT=TCP_Campaign__c 	

:The SF object we're dealing with (as in the SF org)
ENTITY=TCP_Campaign__c 	

: The file where data exported from source org will be placed
FILENAME=%BASEFILEDIR%TCP_Campaign__c\TCP_Campaign_bare.csv

:Fields that will be extracted from source org and loaded into local database
FIELDSTRING=Id, OwnerId, Name, CurrencyIsoCode, CreatedDate, CreatedById, LastModifiedDate, LastModifiedById 

: The SOQL that will be used to run the extraction from source org to populate FILENAME (must contain the same fields, no more no less, as FIELDSTRING)
SOQL=Select Id, OwnerId, Name, CurrencyIsoCode, CreatedDate, CreatedById, LastModifiedDate, LastModifiedById FROM TCP_Campaign__c 

: the fields (which must be present in FIELDSTRING and SOQL) that will be remapped to new IDs using the mapping table in the local database
FIELDSTOREMAP=createdbyid lastmodifiedbyid ownerid

: The file where remapped data exported from the local db will be placed to be loaded into target org
MAPPEDFILENAME=%BASEFILEDIR%TCP_Campaign__c\TCP_Campaign_bare_remapped.csv


: The mapping file required by the Apex Data Loader for insert/upsert operations
SFMAPPINGFILE=TCP_Campaign_all.sdl

: The SOQL that will be used to extract mapping data (Id, OldId__c, a label field for convenience) from the target org
: E.g. the MAPPINGSOQL=SELECT Id, oldid__c, name FROM account would generate entries like oldid: 0012000001ALLIa Id: 0012000001xaCxb tablekey: account_Jack Papadakis DDS
: in the mapping table in the database. The name field (third item in SELECT list need not be unique, but must be provided)
MAPPINGSOQL=SELECT Id, oldid__c, name FROM TCP_Campaign__c

: The file which will be populated from the target org using the MAPPINGSOQL
OLDNEWIDFILENAME=%BASEFILEDIR%TCP_Campaign__c\TCP_Campaign_mapping.csv
