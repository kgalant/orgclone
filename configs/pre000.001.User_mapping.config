#Fields that will be extracted from source org and loaded into local database
FIELDSTRING:

# The SOQL that will be used to run the extraction from source org to populate FILENAME (must contain the same fields, no more no less, as FIELDSTRING)
SOQL:

# the fields (which must be present in FIELDSTRING and SOQL) that will be remapped to new IDs using the mapping table in the local database

# The mapping file required by the Apex Data Loader for insert/upsert operations
SFMAPPINGFILE:

# The SOQL that will be used to extract mapping data (Id, OldId__c, a label field for convenience) from the target org
# E.g. the MAPPINGSOQL=SELECT Id, oldid__c, name FROM account would generate entries like oldid# 0012000001ALLIa Id# 0012000001xaCxb tablekey# account_Jack Papadakis DDS
# in the mapping table in the database. The name field (third item in SELECT list need not be unique, but must be provided)

IMP:0

# Export mapping from target system into local database
# Uses OBJECT, ENTITY, MAPPINGSOQL, OLDNEWIDFILENAME
# Uses MAPPINGSOQL to generate OLDNEWIDFILENAME, then loads/updates it into mapping table in local database
